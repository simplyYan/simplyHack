simplyHack is an easier, faster and lighter way of hacking in general.
The concept is quite simple: simplyHack uses existing tools, but makes them easier and faster to use. In short, simplyHack makes commands more readable and shorter.

## How to use and install
Using it is very simple. Just get a Go module and use 'go get' to get the simplyHack package:
```
go get -u github.com/simplyYan/simplyHack
```
Once installed, simplyHack is very easy to use, just read the documentation and you'll learn how to use it in less than 10 minutes.
You'll need to create and define a TOML, passing the matches and keywords. 

## Documentation
Read the documentation on the [Wiki of this repository](https://github.com/simplyYan/simplyHack/wiki/Docs) or by going to:
```

```

## Requirements
simplyHack doesn't have many requirements, but you will need an internet connection to obviously install it.

## Tools
simplyHack is compatible with any tool, since it's just a transpiler that you configure yourself (manually) that uses Bash and BatchScript to run. You define a custom command and define what it corresponds to, and that's how simplyHack works.
